  I was born and grew up in Tokyo, and have lived in Rochester, N.Y. since 1989
  when I started potting. I worked as a market researcher and was involved with
  many products; foods, soft drinks, magazine, camera and so on. I learned the
  importance of making good products.



  Why pottery? A potter, it sounds good, doesn’t it?



  I dreamed of being one for a long time. I was once told not touch clay because
  it attracts people mysteriously, later days of Picasso, for instance. When
  I married and moved here, my dream was realized with my wife’s warmest support.
  I have had no formal pottery training except a pottery club during my
  university days, when I became possessed by the clay.



  I love making pottery, especially functional; I call it “Zakki (a bunch of
  pots)”. My pots are designed to be simple, easy to handle, and go with any kind
  of foods at a reasonable price for you to use everyday. Japanese use many
  different kinds of dishes, colors and shapes, to decorate a meal and a table.
  Next time you cook or serve a meal, please imagine which dish sets off (cheers
  up) your meal.



  My pottery is stoneware, which is wheel-thrown or slab-built, and fired to cone
  10 (approximately 2350 degrees) in reduction atmosphere. Glazed with tenmoku
  black, or turquoise, inspired by mountains and a sky with a hint of Japanese
  flavor. Indeed, I am named Hodaka after the third highest mountain in Japan
  where I enjoyed camping, climbing and hot springs many times. Vast clouds and
  sky in the US are incredible.



  You can use my pottery with dishwasher, microwave, oven and food with proper
  care. Please keep in mind that pottery, in general, should not be heated
  unevenly. It is recommended that a whole surface of dish is filled with food,
  place pottery with food in it in cold oven. Then turn oven to desired baking
  temperature. (Never broil in it or place piece on a burner!!!.)



  I hope you enjoy my pottery for many years to come.
